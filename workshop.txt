[quote] [h1] Info [/h1] 
- The mod contains around 40 idea groups. With policy count going from vanilla 203 to mine 491, albeit not all unique policies due to scope. Completely reworked policy system from the ground up that can be checked in a spreadsheet in a browser or using both old and new UI in-game.

- This is a standalone version of Ideas and Policies from my main mod which is basically EU4+ at this point.
