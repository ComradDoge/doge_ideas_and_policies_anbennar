- This is a standalone version of Ideas and Policies from my Shattered mod. The base of ideas is "Idea Variation by flogi" but has had massive changes and barely resembles it.

- The mod contains around 50 idea groups, with some being exclusives and religion specific. In addition, a completely reworked policy system from the ground up that can be checked in a spreadsheet.

- Anyone is free to use this mod as they see fit, just add the credits.

- The mod contains around 40 idea groups. With policy count going from vanilla 203 to mine 491, albeit not all unique policies.
- This is a standalone version of Ideas and Policies from my main mod which is basically EU4+ at this point. 
- Completely reworked policy system from the ground up that can be checked in a spreadsheet. I recommend checking the spreadsheet at least once as for compatability with other mods I did not add UI that would serve a familliar purpose.
