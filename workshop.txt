- This is a standalone version of Ideas and Policies from my Shattered mod. The base of ideas is "Idea Variation by flogi" but has had massive changes and barely resembles it.

- The mod contains around 50 idea groups, with some being exclusives and religion specific. In addition, a completely reworked policy system from the ground up that can be checked in a spreadsheet.

- Anyone is free to use this mod as they see fit, just add the credits.
